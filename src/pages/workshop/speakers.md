## NLLP 2024 Keynote: Omri Ben-Shahar (University of Chicago Law School)

**Title**: Privacy Protection, At What Cost?

**Abstract**: Data privacy protection is the dominant paradigm in the regulation of the digital economy. In this keynote lecture, University of Chicago Law Professor Omri Ben-Shahar challenges the adequacy of the data privacy paradigm. He argues that it fails to capture the most worrisome harms—what he calls 'data pollution'—which are inflicted against public rather than private interests. He further demonstrates that privacy-fueled restrictions on valuable data technologies impose a large, mostly unrecognized, harms on society.
