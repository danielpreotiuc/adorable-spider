## Michael Livermore (University of Virginia School of Law)

**Title**: Finding the Law

**Abstract**: This presentation will examine challenges in “finding the law,” for both legal practitioners and scholars engaged in the computational analysis of law. For the practitioner, the challenge is one of search, a process that can be modeled and studied. Although undertheorized, law search has substantial jurisprudential and practical consequences that are only begining to be explored. For the computational scholar, challenges of selection and data bias are pervasive, and credible scholarship must ground descriptive and causal analyses in the actual processes that generate the data available for study.

**Bio**: Michael A. Livermore is a Professor of Law at the University of Virginia. He is one of the early scholars involved in a new research paradigm in legal scholarship that uses computational text analysis tools to study the law and legal institutions. Livermore is the author of dozens of academic works, which have appeared in top law journals as well as peer-reviewed legal, scientific, and social science journals. With Daniel N. Rockmore, he edited Law as Data: Computation, Text, and the Future of Legal Analysis (Santa Fe Institute Press, 2019). Livermore hosts the [Online Workshop on the Computational Analysis of Law](https://michaellivermore.com/owcal/online-workshop/), a global forum for scholars to present cutting-edge research in this area. Livermore is also a leading expert on the use of cost-benefit analysis to evaluate regulation. Prior to joining the faculty, Livermore was the founding executive director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University School of Law, a think tank dedicated to improving the quality of government decision-making. He is a public member of the Administrative Conference of the United States.
